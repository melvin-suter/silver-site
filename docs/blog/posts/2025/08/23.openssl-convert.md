PFX to Key

```
openssl pkcs12 -in filename.pfx -nocerts -out key_pw.pem
```

Remove password from key

```
openssl rsa -in key_pw.pem -out key.pem
```

PFX to Cert

```
openssl pkcs12 -in filename.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out cert.pem
```

## Fixing PFX withs Issues (pfx -> pem -> pfx)

Open Powershell in the bin folder of OpenSSL and run these commands (replace old.pfx is your current, new.pfx will be the fixed one. You might have to enter the pfx password a few times):

```
openssl.exe pkcs12 -in old.pfx -nocerts -out key_pw.pem
openssl.exe rsa -in key_pw.pem -out key.pem
openssl.exe pkcs12 -in old.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out cert.pem
openssl.exe pkcs12 -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem -export -out new.pfx
```
