You’re trying to run `dotnet add package <PACKAGE>` on a RHEL based system and get this error:

```
he command could not be loaded, possibly because:
  * You intended to execute a .NET application:
      The application 'add' does not exist.
  * You intended to execute a .NET SDK command:
      No .NET SDKs were found.

Download a .NET SDK:

```

**Issue**

The problem is, the .rpm inside the microsoft repo has dependencies on packages like `dotnet-hostfxr-6.0.x86_64`, which are also present in the default AppStream repo. So it gets the packages from the wrong repository.

**Solution**

You’re in luck. There is a simple fix:

```dnf remove dotnet-*
dnf install --repo=packages-microsoft-com-prod dotnet-sdk-6.0
```
