ANOTHER graylog issue 😀 yeah

In the UI you could see the graylog node appearing, and disappearing again. It also showed the message “no leader”. BUT, looking at opensearch, you can see the data still comming in. So what happened?

Basically, graylog changed some stuff without telling us, so now it want’s to talk to the node via the hostname. But the node is bound to 127.0.0.1:9000, which the hostname won’t resolve too. So what we do? We add a hosts entry. 🙂

Add this to your /etc/hosts with your hostname:

```
127.0.0.1 hostname hostname.domain.local
```
